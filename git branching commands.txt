to fetch changes from one local branch to another local branch.
in 3 ways we can do
1. You have to tell Git from where to pull, in this case from the current directory/repository (.):
git pull . master

2. But when working locally, you can simply use merge (pull internally calls merge):
git merge master

(OPTIONAL)3. What is meant by "pull internally calls merge"? With default configuration, git pull . master is the same as git fetch . master && git merge FETCH_HEAD
