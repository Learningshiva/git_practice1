to fetch changes from one local branch to another local branch.
in 3 ways we can do
1. You have to tell Git from where to pull, in this case from the current directory/repository (.):
git pull . master

2. But when working locally, you can simply use merge (pull internally calls merge):
git merge master

(OPTIONAL)3. What is meant by "pull internally calls merge"? With default configuration, git pull . master is the same as git fetch . master && git merge FETCH_HEAD

NOte - to reflect changes in the remote repo you have to push the code.
Go to branch
git checkout dev
git push


to rename a branch
SYN - git branch -m new_name
EX - git branch -m developer

to remove the old branch from remote
SYN - git push origin --delete old_branch_name
Ex - git push origin --delete dev

Set the upstream branch details for pushing from the local repo to remote repo.
>git push --set-upstream origin developer

git push
